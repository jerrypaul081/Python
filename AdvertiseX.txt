Assignment Title: Data Engineering Case Study

Imagine you are a data engineer working for AdvertiseX, a digital advertising technology company. AdvertiseX specializes in programmatic advertising and manages multiple online advertising campaigns for its clients. The company handles vast amounts of data generated by ad impressions, clicks, conversions, and more. Your role as a data engineer is to address the following challenges:

Data Sources and Formats:

Ad Impressions:

Data Source: AdvertiseX serves digital ads to various online platforms and websites.
Data Format: Ad impressions data is generated in JSON format, containing information such as ad creative ID, user ID, timestamp, and the website where the ad was displayed.
Clicks and Conversions:

Data Source: AdvertiseX tracks user interactions with ads, including clicks and conversions (e.g., sign-ups, purchases).
Data Format: Click and conversion data is logged in CSV format and includes event timestamps, user IDs, ad campaign IDs, and conversion type.
Bid Requests:

Data Source: AdvertiseX participates in real-time bidding (RTB) auctions to serve ads to users.
Data Format: Bid request data is received in a semi-structured format, mostly in Avro, and includes user information, auction details, and ad targeting criteria.
Case Study Requirements:

Data Ingestion:

Implement a scalable data ingestion system capable of collecting and processing ad impressions (JSON), clicks/conversions (CSV), and bid requests (Avro) data.
Ensure that the ingestion system can handle high data volumes generated in real-time and batch modes.
Data Processing:

Develop data transformation processes to standardize and enrich the data. Handle data validation, filtering, and deduplication.
Implement logic to correlate ad impressions with clicks and conversions to provide meaningful insights.
Data Storage and Query Performance:

Select an appropriate data storage solution for storing processed data efficiently, enabling fast querying for campaign performance analysis.
Optimize the storage system for analytical queries and aggregations of ad campaign data.
Error Handling and Monitoring:

Create an error handling and monitoring system to detect data anomalies, discrepancies, or delays.
Implement alerting mechanisms to address data quality issues in real-time, ensuring that discrepancies are resolved promptly to maintain ad campaign effectiveness.
This Ad Tech case study scenario focuses on the challenges and data formats commonly encountered in the digital advertising industry. Candidates can use this information to design a data engineering solution that addresses the specific data processing and analysis needs of AdvertiseX.

(1) Total Ad Impressions by Creative ID:

SELECT
    creative_id,
    COUNT(*) AS total_impressions
FROM
    ad_impressions
GROUP BY
    creative_id;
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(2) Total Clicks and Conversions by Ad Campaign:

SELECT
    ad_campaign_id,
    SUM(CASE WHEN event_type = 'click' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS total_clicks,
    SUM(CASE WHEN event_type = 'conversion' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS total_conversions
FROM
    clicks_and_conversions
GROUP BY
    ad_campaign_id;
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(3) Top Performing Ad Campaigns by Conversion Rate:

SELECT
    ad_campaign_id,
    COUNT(*) AS total_conversions,
    COUNT(*) / NULLIF(SUM(CASE WHEN event_type = 'click' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END), 0) AS conversion_rate
FROM
    clicks_and_conversions
GROUP BY
    ad_campaign_id
ORDER BY
    conversion_rate DESC
LIMIT 10;

(4) Daily Impressions Trend for a Specific Ad Campaign:

SELECT
    DATE_TRUNC('day', timestamp) AS date,
    COUNT(*) AS total_impressions
FROM
    ad_impressions
WHERE
    ad_campaign_id = 'your_ad_campaign_id'
GROUP BY
    date
ORDER BY
    date;

(5) Hourly Clicks Distribution Across Different Creatives:

SELECT
    DATE_TRUNC('hour', timestamp) AS hour,
    creative_id,
    COUNT(*) AS total_clicks
FROM
    clicks_and_conversions
WHERE
    event_type = 'click'
GROUP BY
    hour,
    creative_id
ORDER BY
    hour, total_clicks DESC;
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

(6) Average Time Between Impression and Click for Each Ad Campaign:

SELECT
    ad_campaign_id,
    AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (click_timestamp - impression_timestamp))) AS avg_time_to_click_seconds
FROM
    (
        SELECT
            i.ad_campaign_id,
            i.timestamp AS impression_timestamp,
            c.timestamp AS click_timestamp
        FROM
            ad_impressions i
        INNER JOIN
            clicks_and_conversions c ON i.user_id = c.user_id
        AND
            i.timestamp < c.timestamp
    ) AS impression_click_pairs
GROUP BY
    ad_campaign_id;
